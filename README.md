0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

This project is part of the ALX software engineering program. The goal is to
create a command-line interpreter for managing objects in a simplified version of 
The AirBnB application. The interpreter allows users to create, update, retrieve, and delete
data related to the application's functionality.

Description of the Project

The AirBnB Clone Console is the first step in building a full-stack clone of AirBnB. This project focuses on the backend, where the command interpreter is the entry point to interact with the system's data. Users can:
Create objects (e.g., users, places, states, cities, amenities, reviews)
Retrieve object information by ID
Update object attributes
Delete objects
Perform data storage and retrieval via a JSON file system
The project sets the foundation for the development of web applications by providing data persistence and command-based interaction.
